# TD 1: Student Instructions

## 0. Check the due date

Make a note about the submission deadline for this assignment (provided in Moodle, and in class). Always make sure to check for any updates. 

## 1. Understanding the lab task(s)

Read `lab.pdf` and listen to the teacher's introduction/explanations. 

## 2. Completing your work

Complete the tasks in `lab1.py`. 

## 3. Submitting your work

Upload the file `lab1.py` here: https://nuage.lix.polytechnique.fr/index.php/s/REEKBqgXGRJbRg9

Note: this requires that you fill in your email address *exactly as is registered in Moodle* into the Python dictionary `info` at the beginning of the file. 

## 4. Checking your work is OK 

Later, you can check that your implementation is 'OK', at the following link: http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~jread/courses/inf581_2023/lab1_selfcheck/index.html

Note: 'OK' does not necessarily mean 'correct', it only guarantees that your solution can be successfully run at grading time in a teacher's python environment, including *but not limited to* automatic tests (make sure to comment your code adequately to be understood easily). 
Note: 'Later' does not mean instantaneously, make sure your code is 'OK' as early as possible, to avoid a late final submission. 

Repeat from step 1. as desired.
